##limites

### qualité du corpus
limite de la méthode inclu les limites du corpus + compounds to article assos.  
Some co-occurencies might stem from article that will be retracted in the future.
Falsification and fabrication can be expected to be overall negligeable/rare events? Evenly distributed among topics??  
If a compound-corpus and a concept-corpus are considered non-independent with a high significant level, with a high overlap cardinality, then a massive bulk retractation would be necessary to invalidate the association.  

however could have huge impact if targeting understudied compounds

Salami-slicing is a bigger problem. The practice is probably increasing + don't lead to retractation? by definition: incirminated articles are not idenpendants and share their topic.  
Mathematically speaking: multiply the count of a sample of article. 1 cooc become 3 or 4.. 

mesh misannotation errors: not likely to be random: trained annotator + probably switch two terms that are close in the thesaurus, and still get the topical concepts..

### relevance

broader concept association != generalization to all child concepts. Overrepresentation of some childs lead to bias.
generalizing to 'siter' terms for childs of cardiovascular disease more reasonnable than generalizing from human to other mamals

non-associations = carful interpretation. Limits is misinterpretation of pvalues
